The ultimate guide to understand the famous moving donut.c in the terminal as well as the cube. All the math is going to be explained. After struggling alone to grasp all the concepts I have decided to make a repo about it to explain everything, especially the math and C syntax that are sometimes obscure.

# What This Repository Contains ?

- Complete source code for both the spinning donut and rotating cube
- Mathematical explanations with LaTeX documentation
- Step-by-step breakdowns of the algorithms
- Detailed comments explaining every concept

# Advices :

I recommend checking the Donut script and the related PDF file first for a better understanding of the concepts, before reading those about the cube, since I have provided much more detailed documentation on the Donut.
 

# Prerequisites : 

- GCC or clang compiler
- Basic understanding of C programming

Example :
Compile the donut with : "clang donut.c -o donut" and run the donut with : "./donut"
