Dancing Donut and Cube in Terminal.

The ultimate guide to understand the famous moving donut.c in the terminal as well as the cube. All the math is going to be explained. After struggling alone to grasp all the concepts I have decided to make a repo about it to explain everything, especially the math and C syntax that are sometimes obscure.

What This Repository Contains ?

- Complete source code for both the spinning donut and rotating cube
- Mathematical explanations with LaTeX documentation
- Step-by-step breakdowns of the algorithms
- Detailed comments explaining every concept

Prerequisites : 

- GCC or clang compiler
- Basic understanding of C programming

Example :
# Compile the donut
clang donut.c -o donut 
# Run the donut
./donut
